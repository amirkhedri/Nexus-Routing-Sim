## 📖 Project Overview
**Nexus** is a comprehensive **Network Routing Simulator** designed to visualize how packets traverse a network topology. It implements core routing algorithms from scratch—including **Link-State (OSPF)**, **Distance-Vector (RIP)**, and **Path-Vector (BGP)**—without relying on operating system sockets.

The project features an advanced **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** that allows users to manipulate network topologies, toggle links on/off, inject packets, and watch them travel node-by-node in real-time based on the calculated routing tables.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 Routing Algorithms (Logic)
* **Link-State (OSPF):**
    * Implements **LSA Flooding** to build a synchronized Link-State Database (LSDB).
    * Runs **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** to calculate the Shortest Path Tree (SPT).
    * Supports **OSPF Areas** (Area 0 vs. Area 1) with Summary LSAs for inter-area routing.
* **Distance-Vector (RIP):** Uses the Bellman-Ford equation to exchange distance vectors and converge based on hop counts.
* **Border Gateway Protocol (BGP):** Simulates inter-AS routing using Path Vectors to prevent loops.

### 🖥️ Interactive Simulation (GUI)
* **Live Topology:** Visualizes Routers, Links, and Costs on a 2D canvas.
* **Packet Animation:** Animates packets moving along calculated paths; handles packet loss if routes are down.
* **Dynamic Changes:** Allows users to **break links** or **change costs** mid-simulation to see how protocols reconverge.
* **Inspection:** Click on any router to view its full **Routing Table** and neighbor relationships.

## 🛠️ Usage

### Running the Simulator
1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/amirkhedri/Nexus-Routing-Sim.git](https://github.com/amirkhedri/Nexus-Routing-Sim.git)
    cd Nexus-Routing-Sim
    ```
2.  Run the main application:
    ```bash
    python main_gui.py
    ```

### How to Test
1.  **Configure:** On the left sidebar, select a **Scenario** (e.g., "Complex") and a **Protocol** (e.g., "Link-State OSPF").
2.  **Run:** Click **"⚡ RUN CONVERGENCE"**. The log will show LSA flooding and table calculation.
3.  **Inspect:** Click a router node (circles) to see its Routing Table on the right.
4.  **Send Packet:** Enter Source `A` and Destination `F` in the "ACTIONS" panel and click **SEND**. Watch the green packet travel.
5.  **Break Links:** Click **"❌ Toggle Link"**, type `A-B`, and re-run convergence to see the route change.
